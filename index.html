An element such as <span>&lt;div&gt;</span> was used as a general-purpose element to create things from headers to footers to articles. With Semantic HTML we were introduced to elements that tell developers and browsers exactly what it does and what content should go in it.</p></td>

Some of these elements are <span>&lt;header&gt;</span>, <span>&lt;nav&gt;</span>, <span>&lt;main&gt;</span>, and <span>&lt;footer&gt;</span>. <span>&lt;header&gt;</span> describes the content at the top of the page <span>&lt;body&gt;</span>. It may include a logo, navigational links or a search bar. <span>&lt;nav&gt;</span> encapsulates the page’s navigational links. It is often placed inside the <span>&lt;header&gt;</span> or <span>&lt;footer&gt;</span>. <span>&lt;main&gt;</span> encapsulates the main content of a page between the header/navigation and the footer areas. <span>&lt;footer&gt;</span> includes the page’s footer content at the bottom of the <span>&lt;body&gt;</span></span>.</p></td>

These elements are universal in that they all use the src attribute to link the source of the content. <span>&lt;video&gt;</span> and <span>&lt;audio&gt;</span> requires a closing tag while <span>&lt;embed&gt;</span> is a self-closing tag.</p></td>

The <span>&lt;figcaption&gt;</span> element is used to describe the media encapsulated within the <span>&lt;figure&gt;</span> element. Developers will normally use <span>&lt;figcaption&gt;</span> within the <span>&lt;figure&gt;</span> element to group the media and description. This way, if a developer decides to change the position of the media, the description will follow along with it.</p></td>

Generally developers will use <Span>&lt;section</Span> to define a theme for the webpage and use <Span>&lt;article&gt;</Span> to write independent content for that theme. This does not mean that <Span>&lt;article&gt;</Span> has to be used with section.</p></td>

                    <td><p>The <span>&lt;aside&gt;</span> element is used to mark additional information that can enhance another element but isn’t required in order to understand the main content. Usually, this information would be in a sidebar or a location where it doesn’t obstruct the main piece of content. An example of this would be an article that discusses how to take care of a dog and next to the article an ad would appear advertising a dog grooming product.</p></td>
